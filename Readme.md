# Mailchain - Encoding

## Mailchain

Mailchain is a multi-chain communication protocol that helps you communicate with your users across any protocol. It provides end-to-end encryption by default, and supports 1:1, 1:many and group messaging.

Using Mailchain you can easily send messages to any blockchain address on different protocols.

## Encoding

Mailchain supports messaging across multiple chains. Each blockchain protocol uses a predefined method for encoding data, including addresses. Mailchain needs to support encode and decode for all blockchain protocols. This repository contains Mailchain encoding functionality.
